			<img class="center" src="../images/shortcut_banner.png" width="65%" height="auto">

			<h2 id="about">About</h2>
			<p class="text" style="text-indent: 50px;">The Awesome_E Hopscotch JSON Siri Shortcut is the <b>ultimate shortcut</b> for viewing and editing your Hopscotch JSON files. It contains <b>over 900</b> actions and can mod just about <i>any</i> aspect of your project. It's already come quite
				a long way, and it will continue to evolve. It all started when I looked into the get file, save file, and Set Dictionary Value blocks. I realized the potential for the Hopscotch Shortcuts combo. Now, I've even come as far as transferring
				code. It's quite amazing and I really suggest you try it if you have not already!</p>
			<p class="text" style="text-indent: 50px;">I looked into the sub-elements of nearly every trait of the "Hopscotch JSON" and realized, "Hey, I could read and write data to this". The shortcut began to advance. From one ability to several, one scene to many, things picked up quickly. And
				here we are now, with presets, filter checking, and secret blocks! It's all here. To learn more about what this shortcut can do, see the features dropdown in the <a href="#%20" onclick="openNav()">navigation</a>. The possibilities are endless.
				You can edit the player version, any object, any piece of code, and even transfer your favorite actions to another project through a preset file.</p>
			<p class="text center" style="text-indent: 50px;">If you have any questions about this or have a bug to report, just ask me <a href="https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/50533">here</a>. I'm always happy to help.</p>

			<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
			<p class="text center">This shortcut is open-sourced, which means that you are free to use it, tinker with it, and remix it!
				<br>This shortcut is compatible with iOS11 Workflow, iOS12+ Shortcuts, and iPadOS Shortcuts.</p>

			<span class="accordion" id="a1content"><ol style="font-size: 120%;">
				<p>The Shortcuts app is installed by default on iOS13 and iPadOS</p>
				<li>Go to Settings and scroll down to "Shortcuts". Tap "Shortcuts" and turn on "Allow Untrusted Shortcuts". This will allow you to run my shortcut.</li>
				<li>Now that you have the app and its proper settings, head back here and find the download links.</li>
				<li>Tap the Download Links in order <b>from left to right</b>, and they should all open the Shortcuts App. Order Matters! Tap "Add Untrusted Shortcut" for each one. Congrats, you now have the Hopscotch JSON Shortcut!</li>
				<li>Give the main shortcut a run! You can now mod any Hopscotch project.</li>
			</ol></span>
			<p class="text center accordControls" style="margin-top: 5px;" id="a2"><b id="a2l">iOS12 Download Instructions</b></p>
			<span class="accordion" id="a2content"><ol style="font-size: 120%;">
				<p>Skip numbers 1 through 3 if you already have the Shortcuts app</p>
				<li>Go to the App Store, and search for "Shortcuts". Tap on "Shortcuts" by Apple. This is the app you need to install if not installed already.</li>
				<li>Tap on "GET", then tap "INSTALL". Enter your AppleID password or ask a parent. Then, allow the app to download.</li>
				<li>Great! Now you have the Shortcuts App. Head back here and find the download section again, as that is where the link can be found.</li>
				<li>Tap the Download Links in order <b>from left to right</b>, and they should all open the Shortcuts App. Order Matters! Tap "Get Shortcut" for each one. Congrats, you now have the Hopscotch JSON Shortcut!</li>
				<li>Give the main shortcut a run! You can now mod any Hopscotch project.</li>
			</ol></span>
			<p class="text center accordControls" style="margin-top: 5px;" id="a3"><b id="a3l">iOS11 Download Instructions</b></p>
			<span class="accordion" id="a3content"><ol style="font-size: 120%;">
				<p>Skip numbers 1 through 4 if you already have the Workflow App</p>
				<li>You will need a second device on iOS12+ for this, but it does not have to be yours. Login to your parent's or your Apple ID on the second device, and go to the App Store.</li>
				<li>Download the Shortcuts app on that device. You do this to put it in the cloud, which is how you can download an older version for iOS11. You can delete it after if necessary.</li>
				<li>Go back to your iOS11 device and make sure you are using the same Apple ID. Open the App Store there, and go to your purchases. To do this, tap your profile icon, then tap purchases.</li>
				<li>Find "Shortcuts", and tap the cloud. Apple will give you a dialog box to download an older version. Click "OK". The download should finish and the app should magically morph into Workflow.</li>
				<li>Come back to this page and find the download links. Tap them <b>in order from left to right</b>, and you should be redirected to the Workflow App. Congrats, you now have the Hopscotch JSON Shortcut!</li>
				<li>Give the stand-alone shortcut a run! You can now mod any Hopscotch project.</li>
			</ol></span>
			<p>The stand-alone shortcut is used to run it from the share sheet or on iOS11. It is used to remove the need for Shortcuts to render all 1400+ actions.</p>

			<h2 id="view">Viewing Projects</h2>

			<p class="text" style='text-align:center;'>This shortcut allows you to view the JSON file of a Hopscotch in several ways. It can be a published project, a draft, or someone else's project.</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify;'>
				<li><b>URL Input:</b> To get view the JSON code of a published project, go to the share sheet by tapping share and entering your age. If you don't see "Shortcuts", go to more and turn it on. Tap on shortcuts. Find "Hopscotch JSON" and tap it.
					A popup will appear with all of that project's code.</li>
				<li><b>View in Safari:</b> This option will be shown when you are prompted with what you want to do with your file. Choosing this option will open a Safari tab containing your project. By doing this, you can find text on the page. To find a certain
					text on the page, type that text in the URL bar, then tap the result under "on this page".</li>
				<li><b>Show Popup:</b> This option, like the option above, is shown when you're asked what to do with your project. Choosing this option shows a popup in the shortcuts app with collapsible keys. Opening and closing these allow you to see more
					of the project and can be super helpful for finding certain words or parameters.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="edit">Editing Projects</h2>

			<h2 id="edit01">Stage Size</h2>
			<div class="flex" r="760" reverse>
				<p>Stage Size was my first step in JSON editing, and it might be yours too, who knows? To edit this using my shortcut, simply change the values on the right-side column (shown in example popup). All tables follow this rule: The trait name on
					the left side should not be changed, and the value on the right is free to mess with.</p>
				<span style="position: relative;"><img src="../images/sc-menu1.png" width="350" height="auto"><span class="cover" style="width: 350px; height: 103.9px; position: absolute; top: 0px"></span>
				<br>
				<a0>&ic;</a0>
				</span>
			</div>
			<p class="belowFlex" r="760" reverse>Stage Size has some interesting traits. It can be negative (thanks MISSION_IMPOSSIBLE), and it also has a upwards limit where trail drawing stops working. Besides its quirks, stage size is actually really useful sometimes. If you want to make
				your game feel like it has more room or you just want to give it a different aspect ratio (width:height), stage size does that perfectly.</p>

			<h2 id="edit02">Editor Version</h2>
			<div class="flex" r="760">
				<span style="position: relative;"><img src="../images/sc-menu2.png" width="350" height="auto"><span class="cover" style="width: 350px; height: 81px; position: absolute; top: 0px"></span>
				<br>Table Showing Version Modifier
				<br>
				<a0>&ic;</a0>
				</span>
				<p>This is one of the two version traits you can modify. Once again, only change the value in the right side column of the table. Version 26 and up gives you the latest editor, 25 gives you the webplayer with the old editor, and 24 gives you
					old the editor mechanics (object variables and alphabetized variables, not the old UI), and projects are not played using the webplayer.</p>

			<p class="belowFlex" r="760">There are advantages of all three versions! Versions 26-30 (30 is the newest) have access to all of the newer blocks (such as destroy), custom rules, and self variables. Version 25 allows you to run secret blocks, but self variables and custom
				rules do not exist. Version 24 is the legacy project version, and it has many different traits about it. For example, objects do not lose quality when scaled up, deprecated blocks such as "move with trail" and "set opacity" work only in versions
				24 and below, and text rendering is far superior to the current engine (no 40-line limit, all unicode works properly, higher quality). Unfortunately, projects with player version 24 run the webplayer when played in Safari, which means text
				renders as it does now and deprecated blocks will only work in the app.</p>

			<h2 id="edit03">Player Version</h2>
			<div class="flex" r="760" reverse>
				<p>Player Version, ah yes. This is the cause of so many current bugs in Hopscotch because of how new it is. It's recommended that you keep projects up to date, which you can do with easily with <a href="#edit14">this</a> [optimize] feature in
					my shortcut. That is mainly due to the fact that the web browsers currently use only the latest version, causing inconsistent gameplay.</p>
				<span style="position: relative;"><img src="../images/sc-menu3.png" width="350" height="auto"><span class="cover" style="width: 350px; height: 81.2px; position: absolute; top: 0px"></span>
				<br>
				<a0>&ic;</a0>
				</span>
			</div>
			<p class="belowFlex" r="760" reverse>Basically, each project has a specific version of the webplayer tied to it, and it uses the latest minor release of that version (1.0.0 uses 1.0.4, 1.1.0 uses 1.1.6, etc.). Newer webplayers usually have a major difference. For example, 1.2.0 and
				above makes it so variables no longer take a frame to execute. There are some bugs with it, but it is definitely something that everyone should get used to. The webplayer is versioned here so that existing projects do not break, but new projects
				will follow the new variable methods. If you are on version 1.0.x, update to 1.1.x. Otherwise, stay where you are.</p>

			<h2 id="edit04">Edited At Date</h2>
			<div class="flex" r="760">
				<span style="position: relative;"><img src="../images/sc-menu4.png" width="350" height="auto"><span class="cover" style="width: 350px; height: 86px; position: absolute; top: 0px"></span>
				<br>
				</span>
				<p>The Edited At Date won't really have an effect on your project. As you can probably tell, it changes the date the draft was edited on, which will also affect the order of your drafts. This trait is edited very easily, as you can type a date
					into several formats, and Shortcuts will also tell you the exact date and time that you are inputting (see the gray text). I haven't tested this yet, but with this method it may be possible to pin a draft that you are not using.</p>
			</div>

			<h2 id="edit05">Base Object Scale</h2>
			<div class="flex" r="760" reverse>
				<p>Finally, we have something that isn't the same when made on different devices. Base Object Scale is the scale factor used to determine the sizes of characters and only characters (shapes and text are not affected by this modification). Just
					like the other traits, change the value on the right and observe the effects. The iPhone generates a project with a default "BaseObjectScale" of 0.5, whilst the iPad's new project has a "BaseObjectScale" of 1.</p>
				<span style="position: relative;"><img src="../images/sc-menu5.png" width="350" height="auto"><span class="cover" style="width: 350px; height: 79.4px; position: absolute; top: 0px"></span>
				<br>
				<a0>&ic;</a0>
				</span>
			</div>
			<p class="belowFlex" r="760" reverse>There aren't that many use cases for this modification because you already have set size, but you may want to use it if you want the shape size to character size ratio to be different. <b>Base</b>ically, if you have a custom rule to initiate something
				3D, but you want to use the same percent in set size for different-sized characters, you could use this to make sure that the characters always appear smaller. Not really an every-project thing, I know, but you might be able to find a use
				for it.</p>

			<h2 id="edit06">Font Size</h2>
			<div class="flex" r="760">
				<span style="position: relative;"><img src="../images/sc-menu6.png" width="350" height="auto"><span class="cover" style="width: 350px; height: 81.1px; position: absolute; top: 0px"></span>
				<br>
				</span>
				<p>This is useful because of Hopscotch's characters per line limit. Normally, each line has room for about 15 emojis in a 1024x768 editor, which ends up being about 600 pixels. In a smaller editor such as the 375x667 editor, text will max out
					at the width of the editor. When the font size is smaller, you can fit more characters onto one line. But ig it is bigger, text will lose less quality when upscaling (increasing the size of) it.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="belowFlex" r="760">By changing this, you can make 16-bit emoji text-arts, something MagmaPOP always wished for. It's too bad that MagmaPOP wasn't here for my shortcut (and the removal of my game changer lol). You can also make larger labels that look nearly as clear
				as editor version 24's text, but at the cost of some line space.</p>

			<h2 id="versions">Change Logs</h2>

			<h2 id="v0.1">What Was in v0.1</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>You can edit the stage size of a project. Choose the project, then choose to modify stage size.</li>
				<li>Scene editing. You could do one of the following:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Add one scene to the project. The Shortcut will switch to that scene automatically.</li>
					<li>Set the Default Scene. This allows you to control which scene you are editing.</li>
					<li>Rename Scenes. This prompted you to enter a name for every scene.</li>
					<li>Delete Scenes. You are prompted to select one or more scenes to delete.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>You could modify the player version of a given project, allowing you to get the old editor (not interface).</li>
				<li>You could change the edited at date for the project.</li>
				<li>You could modify traits of an object such as position and type.</li>
				<li>You could also change the base object scale, which results in sizing characters.</li>
				<li>You were able to change the font size. Smaller font size meant more text on one line, but bigger text size meant less quality loss.</li>
				<li>Variables had their own form of editing. Select "variables" when asked what to modify, then you would get near-raw code for variables.</li>
				<li>You could edit a premade ability called ae_json_edit. This would allow you to mess with parameters and anything within a rainbow block.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v0.2">Changes in Version 0.2</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>You can now view the JSON file of a published project. To do this, open the share sheet, enter your age in the Hopscotch app, and find Run Shortcut (you may have to enable it). Then, find the Hopscotch JSON Shortcut and run that. The JSON
					file will automatically pop up.</li>
				<li>Updated the Shortcut to give you a readable dictionary so you can visualize the composition of the JSON file.</li>
				<li>Supplemental shortcut Generate UUID updated to not require internet</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v0.3">Changes in Version 0.3</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Allows the user to check for updates, meaning that they no longer have to be tagged and download the shortcut manually every time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v0.4">Changes in Version 0.4</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Say goodbye to the days of copy and paste! To insert secret blocks, simply type in {secret_blocks} in the place of one block.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Secret Blocks are put into the ability by default if the ability is blank</li>
				</ul>
				<li>If you do not have an "ae_json_edit" ability, that will now be created for you.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v0.5">Changes in Version 0.5</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Your Siri Shortcut will now update all by itself! There is no need to manually check for updates any more. No personal info, IP Address, or anything of that matter is tracked or collected. Every time you run the shortcut to edit a draft, it
					will check for updates on its own.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v0.6">Changes in Version 0.6</h2><span class="center"><a class="link" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa-TUpSx1JA'>Regex Video</a> <a class="center link" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'>KONZ Video</a></span>
			<ul>
				<li>Check internet will be faster, as I use a smaller image to do so.</li>
				<li>Regexes and KONZ are used to find abilities, drastically reducing time spent searching for the "ae_json_edit" ability.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Previously, I searched every single ability and manually checked the name trait of that ability. Now, I use one expression to find the ability and it outputs exactly one match.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v1.0">Changes in Version 1.0</h2>
			<big style='text-align:center;'>Huge update coming your way! This version includes several new features and improves old features drastically.</big>
			<ul style='text-align:justify; font-size:100%; margin: auto;'>
				<li>You will no longer be prompted to save the project <strong>if no changes</strong> were made</li>
				<li>Modifying <strong>objects</strong> has been reworked. You can now edit multiple objects, either by name or selection. Finding the object has also been made much faster.</li>
				<li>New! Edit <strong>Custom Rules</strong> now by controlling what rules are in there. This can be useful if your custom rule keeps crashing and you want to take out the each rule one by one in a backup to then eliminate it in the original.</li>
				<li>New! Edit <strong>game rule parameters</strong> (you can also copy the abilityID and use that to edit the blocks inside that rule later).</li>
				<li>Revamp! Editing <strong>abilities</strong> can accept several different inputs now. I also fixed a sorting issue, so new abilities created will be in the front as they should be.
					<ul>
						<li style="font-size: 100%;"><strong>ae_json_edit:</strong> The same as before, but it can now accept raw code. This means you can now paste in code from external JSON editors and the file will not be messed up. Does <i>not</i> apply to variables</li>
						<li style="font-size: 100%;"><strong>MIDI Hack:</strong> I integrated MR.GAM3R's Hopscotch MIDI Hack into my Shortcut so that you don't have to do extra file jumping. Just open a MIDI file when prompted, and the ability for your song is automatically created.
							I do not know how well it will work nor how to really modify the MIDI hack, so it's there because many of you might just want to try it, not necessarily because I would or would not recommend it.</li>
						<li style="font-size: 100%;"><strong>By UUID:</strong> This will allow you to edit <i>any</i> piece of code in your project, given that you know the UUID. There are several ways of getting the UUID, and I will have a separate tutorial for this.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>There is a new utility built into the project reader (when you activate it from the share sheet). If your project is in the <strong>filter</strong>, the shortcut will attempt to <strong>scan it</strong> in order to find a word in your project
					that might be causing it to get stuck. Curse words are not a part of this list I compiled, so if that isn't detected, chances are you knew it would be filtered and it should stay filtered.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v1.1">Changes in Version 1.1</h2><span class="center"><a class="link" href='https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/22f97e2b3c5741a1a0b5d15f5f1489e2'>View Dictionary</a> <a class="link"href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'>Free ePoints</a></span>
			<p style='text-align:center'>Make sure to get the view dictionary update as well as the shortcut itself. As per usual, enjoy the shortcut update!</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify;'>
				<li>The rules popup now shows up one time and opens in Safari with pretty-print.</li>
				<li>ae_json_edit bug is now fixed. Sorry about that!</li>
				<li>Filter Regex updated with new words</li>
				<li>Set image blocks are now added in addition to secret blocks (every stage object)</li>
				<li>Dropped the base64 encoding on the filter regex for better accessibility (you will not be affected)</li>
				<li>Filter detection on drafts has been added</li>
				<li>New View Dictionary Shortcut to open Safari popups. The main shortcut will automatically decide when to open the popup. The Safari popup is used because you can use "find in page" on the popup, but it loads slower.</li>
				<li>Removed update template for formatting, which allows me to write raw code for the next changelog</li>
				<li>The shortcut will now detect invalid inputs</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v1.2">Changes in Version 1.2</h2><span class="center"><a class="link" href='https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5a7bc89ab76d4b779c4159071ffcdf57'>Generate UUID</a> <a class="link" href='data:text/html;base64,PGhlYWQ+PG1ldGEgaHR0cC1lcXVpdj0iUmVmcmVzaCIgY29udGVudD0iMDsgdXJsPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXR1YmUuY29tL3dhdGNoP3Y9ZFF3NHc5V2dYY1EiIC8+PC9oZWFkPjxib2R5PjxoMiBzdHlsZT0idGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7Ij5Tb3JyeSwgbm90IGhlcmUuIFNlYXJjaCB0aGUgYWN0dWFsIHNob3J0Y3V0IGluc3RlYWQuPC9oMj48L2JvZHk+'>ePoints Info</a></span>
			<p style='text-align:center;'>Get the View Dictionary Update if you have not updated it since v1.1 (if you got that when downloading v1.1 of my JSON shortcut, you are good). Also, make sure to grab the UUID update, as I fixed a small issue there that would cause presets to
				not work. As per usual, enjoy the shortcut update! ePoints Info has a secret message, and it is not a rick roll (or is it). This monster of a shortcut now has <b>958</b> actions in it!</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify;'>
				<li>Editing <b>Scenes</b> got an overhaul. You can now select multiple actions, add more than one scene at a time, and set a default or first scene multiple times.</li>
				<li>Once again, the <b>filter regex</b> has been <b>updated</b> with new words</li>
				<li>You can <b>use {uuid} to generate a random UUID</b> for your project. This is useful for several things, such as making several hidden abilities by copying one (because you need an abilityID).</li>
				<li>You can now <b>select Custom Rules</b> when modifying rules so you don't have to remember the name anymore.</li>
				<li><b>Presets</b> presets presets! You care now able to save and load code from abilities and custom rules. Choose "presets" when asked what you want to modify. You can save and load presets in any project.
					<ul>
						<li style="font-size: 100%">To save a preset, choose save on the popup menu, then choose the abilities and custom rules you would like to save. Then wait, and save your preset anywhere you'd like.</li>
						<li style="font-size: 100%">To load a preset, simply choose the .hspre (Hopscotch Preset) file from wherever you saved it. Everything will automatically be added to your new project.</li>
						<li style="font-size: 100%">Now, obviously, <b>there are some limitations</b> at the moment. Up to <b>64 nested conditionals</b>, control scripts, etc. are supported. These include blocks inside repeats, if statements, and draw a trail blocks. It should be plenty
							but it is nonetheless a limitation due to the lack of proper for loops in the Shortcuts app.</li>
						<li style="font-size: 100%">The other limitation is <b>variables</b>. Variables unfortunately <b>cannot be saved</b> at the moment. This will hopefully come with a newer update to the shortcut. But, there is an exception. Since the three default variables (velocities
							and bounce height) come with every project, these variables will be saved, renamed or not.</li>
						<li style="font-size: 100%">What gets adopted: Abilities <b>inside abilities</b> and abilities <b>within custom rules</b> <i>will</i> be saved. However, custom rules inside custom rules will <i>not</i> be saved.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>An <b>updated UUID</b> Shortcut is highly recommended. The old one has an issue that incorrectly formatted the UUID, which could lead to presets failing to save bits of code.</li>
				<li>Your project file will be <b>validated</b> upon opening and saving the file. A blank project will inform you that you tried to edit a blank draft, and <b>if you messed up the formatting</b> of an edit, the shortcut will prevent you from saving
					your file. In the past, a mistake like this would cause your project to lose <i>all</i> of its code. But, this <b>does not mean that it is immune</b> to everything. For example, corrupted variables and blocks will vanish, but other variable
					and blocks in abilities will remain. Always be careful with formatting.</li>
				<li>A few descriptions have been tweaked, and there is an easter egg.</li>
				<li><b>Be careful iOS11 users</b>. If you notice that "world" will randomly appear in the project file, you have run into a backwards-compatability issue. Go through the shortcut and if and replace text replaces the text with "world", change it
					so that it replaces the text with nothing. I think there are a couple of instances where this may affect your project, and I may address in a future update.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v1.3">Changes in Version 1.3</h2>
			<p style='text-align:center'>Minor Update</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify'>
				<li>Added Player Version to traits you can modify. This means that you can now change which version of the webplayer you use for the project. Tag me for more info.</li>
				<li>iOS11 users, sorry to keep you waiting (I'm probably the only one anyways). If projects were going corrupt or other unwanted things were happening, it was probably because of the way Replace Text imports. Instead of replacing a phrase with
					a blank string, it replaces the string with "world". I moved the blank text so that it will work as intended.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v1.3.1">Changes in Version 1.3.1</h2>
			<p style='text-align:center;'>Bug Fix, thanks @M_W_K</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify;'>
				<li>Fixed an issue where 4 byte projects were not detected as empty, even though they are the same as the 2 byte project but with 2 line breaks in between.</li>
				<li>Empty projects will now be deleted automatically when passed in so that you do not have to worry about them later</li>
				<li>Fixed an issue where a text object would change its text to its name after editing it</li>
			</ul>


			<h2 id="v1.4">Changes in Version 1.4</h2>
			<p style='text-align:center;'>Back to the Big Changelogs</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify;'>
				<li>There are a few more ways to send an <b>input</b> into the shortcut. Of the input methods, 2 out of the 3 are new, and they allow you to import a project.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The existing method at the moment allows you to input a <b>project URL</b>, and the project's code will be shown.</li>
					<li>Any URL that is <b>not a project link</b> will be checked to see if it is a JSON file. If it is, the link will be converted into a project, and it will <b>import</b> the project and <b>create a draft</b>. Useful for saving a draft of an
						unplayable project.
						<ul>
							<li style="font-size: 100%; text-align: left;">Supported URL types: Data, http, https. Examples: Petrichor's Pixel Art Tool, project JSON links such as https://c.gethopscotch.com/api/v1/projects/zuasmwksm</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Any Text, json, or hopscotch file will be imported as a draft, similar to urls.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Show Preview has an extra option: Skip Preview</li>
				<li>Order of Operations has changed, and the choose traits no longer uses match text. It now uses a normal list, which means the <b>order will stay consistent</b> in the choose menu.</li>
				<li>Editing Scenes has gotten an overhaul. There are changes to every aspect of editng the scene (except deleting).</li>
				<ul>
					<li>When adding a scene, the <b>default scene name</b> will include a number corresponding to its index.</li>
					<li><b>Duplicate Scene Names</b> are not allowed. This is to keep the shortcut from messing up later. Any duplicate name made while creating scenes is <b>changed to a random string</b> corresponding to the object created inside of it.</li>
					<li>The <b>new object</b> created inside of the scene now uses an alphanumeric unique identifier instead of a UUID (universally unique identifier) for its <b>name</b>, meaning it <b>will be shorter</b> but still has an exceedingly high nmber
						of combinations.</li>
					<li>The new object created when making a scene is now placed in the center of the project instead of always being at 512, 384. Sorry iPhone users for that one.</li>
					<li>When <b>reordering scenes</b>, you will have a better <b>prompt</b>. The old one was a little bit confusing, not to say the new one is that much better either.</li>
					<li>The shortcut will limit you in the <b>number of times</b> you can reorder a scene. This is to compensate for typos and extra-long sessions of tapping.</li>
					<li>The <b>set default scene loop</b> will also show the repeat index now.</li>
					<li>Trying to use a <b>duplicate name</b> while <b>renaming scenes</b> will result in an error message, reverting the scene's name.</li>
					<li>You are now able to <b>move objects between scenes</b>. You can even select multiple scenes per object. However, selecting multiple scenes for one object results in that object being duplicated in the code. However, this <b>does not affect the performace</b>					of the project or usage of the shortcut in any major way. (The shortcut will read the extra objects but have no action otherwise)</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Finally off the topic of scenes, phew. When editing <b>objects</b>, duplicate object entries (where from you say) will be removed after objects are selected.</li>
				<li>You are now able to change the <b>UUID of an object</b>. I have no idea why you would want to do this, but do note that <b>you</b> are still <b>responsible</b> for your code.</li>
				<li>If no <b>rules</b> are present after selecting an object or custom rule, you will be <b>alerted</b> before moving on. This also means the popup saying "you are about to edit this rule, keep the formatting" will not appear when you don't have
					any rules to modify.</li>
				<li>You can now use <b>\END\</b> as a uuid to break out of the <b>editing UUID loop</b>. This is for the situation where you have a lot more UUIDs entered compared to what you meant.</li>
				<li>Due to the <b>new Hopscotch update</b>, blank control scripts would not be recognized, as they don't have their own ability. So, of course <b>I'm</b> gonna <b>fix</b> that! When entering an ability ID, it will <b>check</b> if the ability <b>exists</b>				or <b>is referenced</b> (a control script points to it). However, <b>blank rules</b> will still remain untouchable due to how the shortcut works.</li>
				<li><b>Recognition</b> of UUIDs is slightly more <b>lenient</b> now. It will accept some margin of error for instances such as @GameCodingCrazy123's one-digit-too-long UUID.</li>
				<li>Automatic Project <b>Optimization</b> is finally starting! At the moment, only <b>color operators</b> will be automatically simplified when given a constant. Any <b>HSB or RGB</b> color operator inside of a color slot will be converted into
					just a value, <b>saving over 50% in file space</b> required to display the color. Color operators with <b>variables</b> and other forms of data such as <b>math blocks</b> will <b>not be changed</b>.</li>
				<li>Sounds</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v1.4.1">Changes in Version 1.4.1</h2><span class="center"><a class="link" href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cad74683ceea4c31a80d850890b9f6ae">Stand-Alone</a></span>
			<p style='text-align:center;'>Bug Fix we Shall</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify;'>
				<li>Now uses a stand-alone shortcut to run from the share sheet because the main shortcut literally got too big. Download the separate shortcut from the link above, and run the blue "Run HS JSON" shortcut from the share sheet from now on.</li>
				<li>If I'm not mistaken, all error points should be fixed and the Shortcut should be able to run on iOS13. Big thanks to @TheCMStudios for helping me test that out</li>
				<li>Allows Variables to Use Raw JSON Code now. Tip: If you want to use a JSON editor to read this, just find a replace text site or program that can replace two line breaks with a comma. (\n\n = ,)</li>
				<li>New Variable Editing Disclaimer</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug with Edited At which used to add the player version trait to the edited at date</li>
				<li>New Select Traits to Modify Menu, featuring the concept of icons shown on the Shortcut Topic. More of this design will be featured in 2.0, where the shortcut has different modes of running.</li>
				<li>More Error Sounds for mid-shortcut popups</li>
				<li>Minor Code Reorganizing</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="v1.5">What's New in Version 1.5</h2>
			<p style='text-align:center;'>ok fine here is an update</p>
			<ul style='text-align:justify;'>
				<li>Added a word to the filter list after the longest time</li>
				<li>Objects will now update when their UUID is changed</li>
				<li>You can now edit traits of an ability, such as the name, date of creation, etc.</li>
				<li>Variables will now transfer in presets. However, try to avoid duplicate imports, as duplicate variables will not be removed yet. I will work on that in the future.</li>
				<li>Color Optimization has been adjusted so that your new colors will not be affected by Hopscotch's conversion error</li>
				<li>Your player version can automatically update now. Do note that many complex projects will break through this process though, as there is a timing bug at this moment in time.</li>
				<li>You can now choose to fill blank conditionals, as older player versions still have the blank conditional freeze issue.</li>
				<li>Secret Blocks got some label changing for destroy to adjust to the new update.</li>
			</ul>
