# Hopscotch Tools

Find the site [here](https://awesome-e.github.io/hs-tools/). This is where I uploaded several tools regarding Hopscotch Projects and their JSON structure.

### Hopscotch Help Guide

A collab project about blocks in Hopscotch I am working on. Collect info about the blocks and I put it into here.

To use this help guide, simply search the block you are looking for

### Shortcut Help Guide

Self explanatory

### Videos

I store video clips here and can link them occasionally

### Filter Checker

This can check how your project gets stuck in the filter, as well as extract all the text from a project.

## Add to Home Screen

On iOS, this can be made into a web app. To do this, navigate to [the page](https://awesome-e.github.io/hs-tools/). Then, click on share, and scoll over. Tap "add to home screen" and tap add. It functions pretty much just like an app once added. Takes up zero storage but requires internet.
