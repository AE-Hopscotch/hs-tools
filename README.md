# Hopscotch Tools

Find the site [here](https://awesome-e.github.io/hs-tools/). This is where I upload several tools regarding Hopscotch Projects and their JSON structure.

### Hopscotch Help Guide

A collab project about blocks in Hopscotch I am working on. Info collected about the blocks are put here. Anyone can contribute to the project, as help is highly appreciated.

To use this help guide, read the recommended blocks or use the search bar.

### Shortcut Help Guide

Self explanatory (Go [here](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/this-siri-shortcut-can-modify-your-projects/50533) for questions about the shortcut or the help guide)

### Videos

I store video clips here and can link them occasionally. You'll see me use these for project updates, modding clips, etc.

### Filter Checker

This can check how your project gets stuck in the filter, as well as extract all the text from a project. You can read more about Hopscotch's filter system on [this forum topic](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/the-my-project-is-stuck-in-the-filter-topic/49234/441).

### Hopscotch Web Explorer

You can browse the community with this new addition. Pick from Hopscotch's channels, my custom picks, or even search for your favorite creators. This functions just like the app and can be used on any device that has an internet connection. No longer will you be limited to iOS to play projects.

You can ask questions about this explorer and find updates on [this thread](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/hopscotch-web-explorer/53971).

## Add to Home Screen

On iOS, this can be made into a web app. To do this, navigate to [the main page](https://awesome-e.github.io/hs-tools/). Then, click on share, and scoll over. Tap "add to home screen" and tap add. It functions pretty much just like an app once added. Takes up zero storage but requires internet.
